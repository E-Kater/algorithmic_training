You have a transparent box. Box contains stationary obstacle (which do not move) and stones which can move if you shake or rotate the box.
You wonder what will happen if you rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise. Write a program which will get the answer (The box is not yours, so, you’d better solve this question theoretically, without risky experiments with rotating a box).
You are given a rectangular array which denoted objects in the box:

‘#’ — stationary obstacle
‘O’ — stone
‘.’ — empty space
When you rotate a box, stones may fall because of gravity. You should build an array which will describe state of the box after rotation.

Input format
First line contains two integer numbers
1
≤
N
,
M
≤
5
0
0
 — height and width of the box respectively. Each of next
N
 lines contain
M
 characters (without space character between them). Each character is ‘#’ or ‘O’ or ‘.’.
It is guaranteed that all stones in the initial state lie on border of the box, on obstacles or on other stones.

Output format
Print M lines with N character in each. Each character should be ‘#’ or ‘O’ or ‘.’ — the state of the box after rotation 90 degrees clockwise and after all stones will fall down and take their places.

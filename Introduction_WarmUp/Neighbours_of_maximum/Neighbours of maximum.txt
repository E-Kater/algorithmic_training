Given array of integer values. Find all maximum values and print them together with their neighbours. Print values in the same order in which they appear in the initial array.
Input format
First line contains one integer value
1
≤
N
≤
1
0
0
0
  — number of items in the array.
Next line contains

 integer values
0

 — items of the array.

Output format
Print items of the initial array which are either maximum values or neighbours of maximum values. Values should be printed in the same order in which they appear in the initial array. Each value should not be printed more than once.

Notes
Test 1: Maximum of [0, 2, 1, 2, 0] is 2. Indices of maximum values are 1, 3. Indices 0 and 2 are neighbours of 1; 2 and 4 are neighbours of 3. So, all the items should be printed.
Test 2: Maximum of [0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0] is 2. Indices of maximum values are 1, 5. Indices of 0 and 2 are neighbours of 1; 4 and 6 are neighbours of 5. So, items with indices 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 should be printed.
Test 3: Maximum of [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. All items are maximums, so all of them should be printed.

MSAI teachers are organizing an exam in another university and they are worried about cheating possibility. Of course, this exam is not in MIPT, because MIPT students do not cheat. Usually :)
So, teachers decided to prepare sitting places for examinees on a straight line, to be able to see them all. Also, to minimize possibility of using each other's solutions, teachers want to maximize minimum distance between students. Help them, please!
Classroom has 2≤ N ≤ 10000 sitting places, which are situated on a straight line. Their coordinates are 0 ≤ xi ≤ 109. You need to assign M students to seats (choose M seats: xk1, xk2, ..., xkM) such that minimum distance between students is as much as possible:

Write a program which will do that.
Input format

First line contains 2 integer numbers N, M divided by space character: 2 ≤ N ≤ 10000, 2 ≤ M ≤ N — number of sitting places and students respectively.
Next line contains N integer numbers 0 ≤ xi ≤ 109 — coordinates of sitting places.
Output format

Print single integer number — desired maximized minimum distance:

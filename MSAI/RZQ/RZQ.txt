After Lecture 9 on Algorithms and Data structures at MSAI, your are very interested in different range queries.
The last idea which interested you is RZQ. RZQ(l, r) — number of zeroes in the array in range [l, r):

You have found a dynamic (non-constant) array and are experimenting with it. You want to check if it's possible to compute RZQ queries using  operations.
You have an initial array a which consists of N elements |ai| ≤ 104. You have requests of 2 types:
? l r — RZQ(l, r). 0 ≤ l < r ≤ N
or
+ i delta — inc(i, delta): increase a[i] value by delta. 0 ≤ i < N; |delta| < 104
Provide an answer for each "?" request.
Input format

First line contains two integer numbers: 0 < N, M ≤ 105 — number of items in array and number of requests.
Second line contains N integer numbers divided by space character: initial state of a array. |ai| ≤ 104.
Each of following M lines contain one character ("?" or "+") followed by two integer numbers. This line describes a request:
? l r — RZQ(l, r). 0 ≤ l < r ≤ N
+ i delta — inc(i, delta). 0 ≤ i < N; |delta| < 104
Output format

For each "?" request print one integer number — answer for RZQ request.
